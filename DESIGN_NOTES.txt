Title: 'Give Up Never Goblinr: Homosapiens Overrated' (GUNG-HO)

For Sufficiently Complex Gameplay, Party-Based Required:
 In the same way the User is meant to keep the buildings safe in
 'Into the Breach', in GUNG:HO your party members are your
 buildings, and they die easily. Run out of fellow goblins,
 and your character loses the will to continue.

 Yet, without endagering your party members, you will never
 make it to kill Empah* Yendor. (*made up genderless
 word for 'emperor/empress')

Gun-Goblin IDea:
 Setting is the deep caverns of a goblin warren within the crust
 of post-human Earth. The PC is a digger, the lowest class in
 this warren society, but one day at work they dig up an ancient
 relic: A six-shooter, fully loaded and operational - preserved
 within an otherwise empty gunsafe, hinges devoured by rust.

 With this gun, the player character is given six "outs", or
 easy kills for use in dangerous battles. A way to ease a brand
 new player into a game that's challenging from the start. Or
 a test of skill for an experienced player - save the gun for
 the late game, or never use it at all.

 This item allows the difficulty curve to reach an absurd level,
 which should never be a part of the base design, but because of
 the GIMMICK, it's important to give the player a way to beat a
 their old character - no matter how OP they were.

GIMMICK:
 The final boss is GOBLIN CEO. When you defeat him (and thus win
 the game), the next time you reach the GOBLIN CEO it will be a
 copy of that character which you previously beat the game with,
 including - most importantly - your character's name. But the
 GOBLIN CEO will never have the gun, even if your past character
 had it.

Gameplay:

 Stages > Levels

 Each stage is a puzzle, challenge, xor story element.

 Each stage is a small square grid of fixed size, populated via procgen
 with terrain, hazards, and hostiles.
	(Benefits: Easier to program, test, and store;
		   divides the game into discrete puzzles;
		   allows for hand-crafted levels, sometimes.
	..)

=========================
========= STORY =========
=========================
At fixed points throughout the map, configured like the FTL sector map, there
are story nodes. Each node has a set of possible story elements, chosen at
random from a culled subset such that it makes sense based on the character's
previously selected story nodes.

=========================
===== Card-Actions ======
=========================

What if each weapon gave its users a sub-deck of cards, added to the 'library'
of the wielder. When the weapon is unequipped these cards are removed from the
'library'.
