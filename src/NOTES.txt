- Context Menu Prototype
Implemented!
BUGs:
-No range limitation on Intent insertion via Cursor-activated C_Menu. Because
both the Player's position (Point) and the cursor's position (Cursor) are
globally available resources, it should be trivial to implement an adjacency
check as a gui.rs fn to solve this.
-Ranged Use items auto-target the player when "Used" via C_Menu.

Next:
Nested Menus:
e.g. Selecting the "Attack" option opens a new C_Menu with "Melee" and
"Ranged" options.

- Resistances:
Implement temp resistance boosts via barrier_scroll.

- Weapon Attack Mode Switching

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FLUFF NOTES:
- Backpack as a uber-bag-of-holding, a godly gift bequeathed upon the hero at
the beginning of the journey. "It's dangerous to go alone, take this:" ...
"A... bag?" The bag is a named artifact: All Mother. "If you can lift it, All
Mother can carry it."

DESIGN PILLARS:
- Typed Damage/Resistances/Immunities
- Multiple Attack Modes per Weapon(i.e. Knife can be used to Stab, Cut, or
  Pommel-bludgeon).
- Universal Context-Menu!
- Language-based user-customizable spellcasting!
- Party-Based Singleplayer stretch_goal(& Multiplayer)!

PLAN:
- Refactor & implement features as they interest me, look back to RLTK
  Tutorial for inspiration & implementation proof-of-concepts.

BUGS:
- "yen" symbol showing up as "crossed zero" symbol. Issue is in RLTK code. 

FUTURE PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS:
- Separate EquipSystem from UnequipSystem so I can do a proper join without
  iterating over all living entities each frame to look for
  (EquipIntent).maybe() and (UnequipIntent).maybe().

AT THE END I WILL HAVE...:
- Lovingly Cultivated my Focus and Discipline
- Learned much about Rust
- Learned much about ECS Architecture
- Learned much about Game Dev
- Learned much about Roguelikes
- Learned much about VIM
- Learned much about working from the Linux Terminal.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DESIGN NOTES:
- Damage & MeleeIntent: Damage is particulate, the smallest quantity being a
  DamageAtom enum which holds exactly one of several damage types and a value.
	MeleeIntent is added first to a creature that wants to attack, then
	the intent propogates to that creature's equipment. Behind the scenes,
	each item individually applies its own damage. They are agregated into
	a Vec<DamageAtom> before being filtered by Resistances and applied to
	the MeleeIntent target' stats.


SOLVED PROBLEMS:
- THE GREAT MISUNDERSTANDING
I have been assuming that UseIntent attaches to the Item entity, but in fact
it attaches to the Creature entity who is using the item. 
- IMPLEMENTING STATE INTO MENUS
Appeared daunting but it turns out I have the skills to implement this. Now
the inventory menu has two States: select items-in-backpack or select equipped
items.
- GLOBAL TOGGLE-ABLE TOOLTIPS
Fell into the impossible attempt of trying to create a boolean toggle without
initializing the variable out of scope.
