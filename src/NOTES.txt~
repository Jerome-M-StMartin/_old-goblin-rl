Fix Bug:
- No "Drop" option on equipped Torches (& probably all equippables).

Do Next:
- Get to new Turn System in Tutorial to use as foundation.
- New AP-based Turn System
- Temp Resistances
- Weapon Attack Mode Switching
- AI
- ProcGen Improvement
- Control Hierarchy is a little messy

TEST:
- Bloodstains & Bleeding: Give Orcs 12hp & make Longswords common.

DESIGN NOTES:
- Damage & MeleeIntent: Damage is particulate, the smallest quantity being a
  DamageAtom enum which holds exactly one of several damage types and a value.
	MeleeIntent is added first to a creature that wants to attack, then
	the intent propogates to that creature's equipment. Behind the scenes,
	each item individually applies its own damage. They are agregated into
	a Vec<DamageAtom> before being filtered by Resistances and applied to
	the MeleeIntent target' stats.
- Status Damage:
  DamageAtom::Bleed/Poison/Suffocation/etc first remove FP before reducing HP.


SOLVED PROBLEMS:
- THE GREAT MISUNDERSTANDING
I have been assuming that UseIntent attaches to the Item entity, but in fact
it attaches to the Creature entity who is using the item. 
- IMPLEMENTING STATE INTO MENUS
Appeared daunting but it turns out I have the skills to implement this. Now
the inventory menu has two States: select items-in-backpack or select equipped
items.
- GLOBAL TOGGLE-ABLE TOOLTIPS
Fell into the impossible attempt of trying to create a boolean toggle without
initializing the variable out of scope.
