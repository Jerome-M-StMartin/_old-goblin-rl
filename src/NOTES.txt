- Nested Player Menu:
Need to impl dirty flags for Menuable options list,
so that when an item is in player's menu it doesn't
have the Pick Up option, etc.

- Resistances:
Implement temp resistance boosts via barrier_scroll.

- Weapon Attack Mode Switching

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FLUFF NOTES:
- Backpack as a uber-bag-of-holding, a godly gift bequeathed upon the hero at
the beginning of the journey. "It's dangerous to go alone, take this:" ...
"A... bag?" The bag is a named artifact: All Mother. "If you can lift it, All
Mother can carry it."

DESIGN NOTES:
- Damage & MeleeIntent: Damage is particulate, the smallest quantity being a
  DamageAtom enum which holds exactly one of several damage types and a value.
	MeleeIntent is added first to a creature that wants to attack, then
	the intent propogates to that creature's equipment. Behind the scenes,
	each item individually applies its own damage. They are agregated into
	a Vec<DamageAtom> before being filtered by Resistances and applied to
	the MeleeIntent target' stats.


SOLVED PROBLEMS:
- THE GREAT MISUNDERSTANDING
I have been assuming that UseIntent attaches to the Item entity, but in fact
it attaches to the Creature entity who is using the item. 
- IMPLEMENTING STATE INTO MENUS
Appeared daunting but it turns out I have the skills to implement this. Now
the inventory menu has two States: select items-in-backpack or select equipped
items.
- GLOBAL TOGGLE-ABLE TOOLTIPS
Fell into the impossible attempt of trying to create a boolean toggle without
initializing the variable out of scope.
- WASD-CURSOR - 6/14/2020
- TEXT CONFUSION - 6/17/2020
simple8x8 text resource not 1:1 with cp_437 standards. Was confusing.
- UNIVERSAL CONTEXT MENU - 6/18/2020
- NESTED PLAYER MENU - 6/21/20
